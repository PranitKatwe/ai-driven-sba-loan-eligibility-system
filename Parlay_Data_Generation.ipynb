        "\n",
        "The code provided generates synthetic data for small business loan applicants, simulating key business metrics like revenue, debt, net operating income (NOI), and business ownership structure. This synthetic dataset is primarily created to mimic real-world business conditions in the U.S., and it can be used for financial modeling, machine learning applications, or scenario testing. The synthetic data is generated from an existing Excel file with 50 rows of original data, ensuring that it aligns with the characteristics and trends of real business loan applicants.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Input Data\n",
        "\n",
        "The synthetic data is generated based on the data from the provided **Modified Data.xlsx** file. This original file includes 50 rows of business applicant data that serve as the basis for generating the synthetic dataset. Key characteristics of the original data are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Business Structure**: Includes business types such as LLC, Sole Proprietorship, S-Corp, and others. The majority of small businesses seeking SBA loans are LLCs, Sole Proprietorships, or S-Corps.\n",
        "- **Business Location**: All businesses are located in the U.S., with location data in the format \"City, State\" (e.g., Denver, CO).\n",
        "- **NAICS Code**: Each business has a valid NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) code, which is essential for determining loan eligibility.\n",
        "- **Credit Scores**: Both personal and business credit scores are adjusted within specified ranges, reflecting typical values seen in real business loan applicants.\n",
        "\n",
        "The synthetic data generated maintains the same structure and follows realistic distributions based on these characteristics.\n",

        "#### Data Considerations\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are key considerations for the synthetic data based on the provided **Modified Data Considerations**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Business Structure**:\n",
        "   - Small businesses typically apply for SBA loans as LLCs, Sole Proprietorships, or S-Corps. Other types such as C-Corps, Partnerships, and Nonprofits are rare.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Location**:\n",
        "   - All businesses are located within the U.S., which aligns with SBA loan eligibility.\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **NAICS Code**:\n",
        "   - A valid NAICS code is assigned to each business. Some NAICS codes may not be eligible for certain loan products, which is important for real-world loan approval processes.\n",
        "   \n",
        "4. **Credit Scores**:\n",
        "   - Personal credit scores range from 300 to 850, while business credit scores range from 0 to 300. The majority of applicants have business credit scores between 100 and 200.\n",
        "   \n",
        "5. **Business Ownership**:\n",
        "   - Ownership distribution is simulated to reflect the common reality that small businesses often have one or two owners. Ownership values greater than 20% are generated with a higher frequency, but 3+ owners are rare.\n",
        "   \n",
        "6. **Revenue and Debt**:\n",
        "   - Annual revenue values for the last three years are generated to follow realistic patterns, with revenues typically being whole numbers. The Net Profit Margin (NPM) is capped at 15%, and NOI (Net Operating Income) is always less than revenue for each year. Debt values are based on the revenue trends of the business.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Loan Amount**:\n",
        "   - Loan amounts are whole numbers, typically ranging between $500,000 and $5 million. Small businesses may sometimes request lower amounts, but these values are kept within realistic bounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Use of Funds**:\n",
        "   - Boolean columns are used to indicate specific use cases for the loan, such as working capital, business expansion, equipment leasing, etc. Each column is encoded as `True` or `False`.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)**:\n",
        "   - DSCR is calculated as the ratio of NOI to business debt, and it falls within a realistic range of 0.4 to 2.0. A higher DSCR (e.g., 1.25 or greater) indicates better business financial health.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Other Features**:\n",
        "    - Features such as collateral availability, industry experience, managerial experience, and whether the applicant requests fast loan approval are also included, reflecting real-world business loan applications.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    - The business ownership columns, ranging from `Business Ownership (1)` to `Business Ownership (5)`, capture how ownership is distributed within the company, with higher weights for 1 or 2 owners.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **Challenges for Loan Eligibility**:\n",
        "    - Factors like the business structure, location, NAICS code, credit scores, DSCR, and loan amount all affect the loan eligibility and loan fit. These considerations are relevant when applying real machine learning models for loan decision-making.\n",
